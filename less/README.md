# Dutch Less files

The Dutch view is based on the Default view, listing here are the files that are changed (or new) compared to this Default view.

## Changed

Only 2 files have a lot of changes, most files have small changes for the `@import` rules, in stead of importing `default` less files, `dutch` less files are imported.

The 2 files with all the changes

- web-ui/src/main/resources/catalog/views/dutch/less/gn_variables_default.less (for the colours)
- web-ui/src/main/resources/catalog/views/dutch/less/gn_view_dutch.less (for all Dutch overrides)
