# A custom view for GeoNetwork: 'Dutch Government Skin'

This project contains a skin for the GeoNetwork Opensource project at https://github.com/geonetwork. A skin generally consists of a number of overrides for templates (html), styles (less) and scripts (js). The skin can be added to a GeoNetwork core sources as a git submodule or as a zipfile to a pre-build war.

## Features:
- Design slightly follows [dutch rijkshuisstijl](https://www.rijkshuisstijl.nl/)
- RD-new projection is made available
- PDOK background layers as map backgrounds
- PDOK locationserver as gazeteer

This work has been started by Kadaster Netherlands and is further maintained by the GeoNetwork Usergroup Netherlands. If you find any issues, use the github issue tracker here https://github.com/osgeonl/geonetwork-dutch-skin/issues.

A preconfigured skin is available as docker image at https://hub.docker.com/r/geocat/geonetwork-nl/

# Installation instructions

## If at build time (mvn install)

- Initialise the skin as a git submodule in /web-ui/src/main/resources/catalog/views

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/osgeonl/geonetwork-dutch-skin.git web-ui/src/main/resources/catalog/views/dutch 3.4.x
git submodule init
```

## If at run time (war)

- Deploy the latest geonetwork `3.4.x` WAR from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geonetwork/files/GeoNetwork_opensource/)
- Grab a zip of https://github.com/osgeonl/geonetwork-dutch-skin/tree/3.4.x
- Unzip it in /geonetwork/catalog/views/dutch

## Then

Some additional settings on the main project

- In `/catalog/js/gnLocale.js`, reference the skin language override file `/catalog/views/dutch/locales/nl-core.json` (line 90)

```javascript
options.locales.push('/../../catalog/views/dutch/locales/{{lang}}-core.json');
```

- In pom.xml, configure the database type and connection details, `Language.default`, `Language.forcedefault`.
- Check https://github.com/metadata101/iso19139.nl.geografie.1.3.1 and https://github.com/metadata101/iso19139.nl.services.1.2.1 how to add dutch schema plugins
- On 'Admin > Settings' and 'Admin > Settings > User Interface' configure things such as catalog title, logo, url, map extent, etc.
- On 'Admin > Settings' and 'Admin > Settings > User Interface' set the default map to load to use the thematic map with pdok-backgrounds at `../../catalog/views/dutch/config-nl-viewer.xml`
